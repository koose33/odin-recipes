    <h1>Breakfast Burger</h1>
    <img src="../images/recipe-3.jpg" alt="Photo of burger with egg and ham added filling" height="400" width="750">
    <p>This isn't your average burger. It's breakfast and lunch combined into one indulgent masterpiece. A juicy beef
        patty is topped with crispy bacon, a perfectly fried egg, melted cheese, and hash browns all stacked between a
        toasted bun. It's the ultimate comfort food for those mornings when cereal just won't cut it.
        The runny egg yolk acts as a rich sauce that brings all the components together. Best enjoyed with a side of
        crispy fries and plenty of napkins, because this burger is delightfully messy.
