    <h1>BBQ Chicken Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/recipe-2.jpg" alt="Photo of barbecue chicken pizza" height="400" width="750">
    <p>A sweet and savory twist on traditional pizza that has become a crowd favorite. Tangy barbecue sauce replaces
        marinara as the base, topped with tender chicken, red onions, fresh cilantro, and a blend of mozzarella and
        gouda cheeses. The combination creates a perfect balance of smoky, sweet, and cheesy flavors in every bite.
        Originally popularized by California Pizza Kitchen, this pizza proves that thinking outside the traditional
        Italian box can lead to delicious results. It's an excellent choice for pizza night when you want something a
        little different from the usual pepperoni.
