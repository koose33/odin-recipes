# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website featuring three recipes with images, descriptions, ingredients lists, and step-by-step cooking instructions. Each recipe page links back to the main directory and connects to other recipes for easy navigation.

## Purpose

This project is part of my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer. It helps me understand how code works at a fundamental level by building a multi-page website from scratch using only HTML.

## Skills Practiced

- Creating relative links between HTML pages
- Linking images from relative file paths
- Building ordered and unordered lists
- Structuring multi-page websites with proper navigation
- Organizing files in a logical directory structure
- Using HTML boilerplate and semantic elements

## Recipes Included

- Cilantro Lime Tacos
- Breakfast Burger
- BBQ Chicken Pizza

## What I'm Learning

Through this project, I'm focusing on best practices for organizing and structuring HTML in preparation for adding CSS later. Understanding proper HTML structure now will make styling much easier when I revisit this project in the future.

## Future Plans

I plan to return to this project later in the curriculum to add CSS styling and transform it into a visually appealing site. The HTML structure I'm building now will serve as a foundation that could be adapted for other types of websites with similar organizational needs.
